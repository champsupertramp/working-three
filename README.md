### @Front-end developers
 - Less files should be in `/assets/less/`
 - Generated CSS files should be located in `/assets/css/`
 - Images `assets/img/`
 - Plugins/vendors `assets/vendor`
   - If you know how to use bower, just load all dependencies there.
   - To merge scripts and move js files to designate folders, just add your command in `Gruntfile.js`
   - Note: Ask @champsupertramp if you need any help/assistance.
 - Add your HTML files in the root folder.

### @Back-end/WordPress
